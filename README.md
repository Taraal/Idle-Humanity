Personal project to create an idle game ! 

This is my first project in Unity, it will probably suck, but who cares anyway.
I'm following a tutorial video series by CryptoGrounds which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRX068YHKf8&list=PLGSUBi8nI9v-a198Zu6Wdu4XoEOlngQ95)

I'm having fun
